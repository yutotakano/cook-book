        <h2 id="dough">Dough</h2>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>0.5kg plain flour</li>
<li>1 large eggs</li>
<li>1 glass of lukewarm water</li>
<li>1 tbsp of oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>To make the dough:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix flour and salt in a bowl/on a kneading board (as for pasta).</li>
<li>Make a well in the centre and add the eggs and oil into it.</li>
<li>Mix together, slowly adding water, until it forms a smooth and non-sticky dough.</li>
<li>Leave to rest, covered by a clean tea towel or cling film, for 30mins.</li>
</ol>
<p>To prepare the pierogi:</p>
<ol>
<li>Split the dough in half; leave one half covered and roll out the second half on a well-floured surface. You want the dough to be fairly thin, around ~2-3mm of thickness.</li>
<li>Using the rim of a floured drinking glass, cut out circles in the rolled-out dough.</li>
<li>Picking up one circle at a time, put in the filling — 1-2 teaspoons, depending on your confidence, fold the circle in half and crimp the edges shut.</li>
<li>Repeat until all the pierogi are prepared. Keep the finished pierogi on a floured baking sheet and covered so they don&rsquo;t dry out.</li>
</ol>
<p>To cook the pierogi:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working in batches, put the pierogi in boiling water. Reduce to a simmer, and cook for a few minutes; once they start rising to the surface, check for doneness. Remove with a slotted spoon once done.</li>
</ol>
<p>To serve:
The cooked pierogi can be eaten or reheated as they are - or you can pan-fry them in a bit of oil and serve them with some caramelized onions, fried bacon bits, and some sour cream.</p>
<h2 id="fillings">Fillings</h2>
<h3 id="mushroom-and-sauerkraut">Mushroom and sauerkraut</h3>
<h4 id="ingredients-1">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>200g-400g sauerkraut, to taste</li>
<li>One bag of dried mushrooms (~20g) or one box of fresh brown mushrooms (~200g)</li>
<li>(Optional) One bay leaf</li>
<li>Onions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="method-1">Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water for around 30 minutes. Drain most of the soaking liquid, reserving some for adding later. Chop roughly.</li>
<li>Drain and rinse the sauerkraut, chop roughly.</li>
<li>Add the sauerkraut and dried mushrooms (and optionally the bay leaf) to a pot. Cook for 30-40 minutes, adding liquid if needed, until the sauerkraut is cooked.</li>
<li>While the sauerkraut is cooking, fry the onions in a bit of oil, optionally caramelizing. If you are using fresh mushrooms, finely chop them and fry them in the same pot.</li>
<li>Mix the sauerkraut and the onions together to make the filling. Remember to remove the bay leaf!</li>
