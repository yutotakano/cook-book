        <p>This no-bake roll with biscuits and cocoa is a Romanian family favorite dessert!
Inspired by 
<a href="https://www.lauraadamache.ro/2013/12/salam-de-biscuiti.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe</a>
 with a couple of modifications.</p>
<p>Serves <strong>an entire family</strong></p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>200g butter biscuits (you can add more to taste - Leibniz type biscuits should work best)</li>
<li>50g cocoa powder</li>
<li>130g butter</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>125g sugar (either brown or white)</li>
<li>50g dark chocolate (at least 50% cocoa)</li>
<li>rum essence (not necessary but it makes the taste <em>much</em> better - any Polish store should have it)</li>
<li>vanilla sugar</li>
<li>powdered sugar</li>
<li><em>extra filling</em>: nuts, almonds, raisins, cranberries, candied fruit, finely chopped Turkish delight, coconut flakes, or several of these!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Melt the butter and chocolate on low heat until fully melted. Make sure not to melt the butter more than necessary. Let the mixture cool down.</li>
<li>Take 120g of biscuits and crush them until they turn into small crumbs (make sure they&rsquo;re small, as they make the roll stick together).</li>
<li>Melt the sugar in 90ml milk and add it to the crushed biscuits.</li>
<li>Break up the rest of the biscuits into larger pieces and add them to the mix along with the cocoa powder, rum essence, and the butter-chocolate mixture (which should be cold).</li>
<li>Add a few teaspoons of cold milk and start mixing until homogenous. If you can make a little ball from the mix without it crumbling, it has a good consistency - if not, add more milk.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the powdered sugar on a board and start rolling the dough/mix on it, giving it a cylindrical, salami-like shape. Wrap in tin foil and make sure to twist the ends tight.</li>
<li>Leave in the fridge for a <em>minimum</em> of 3-4 hours, preferably over the night. The more you leave it, the better it will be cut when you open it.</li>
<li>Enjoy in 1.5 cm slices, not too thin!</li>
</ol>
