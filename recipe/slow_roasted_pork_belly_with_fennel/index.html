Season generously with salt and pepper rubbing it well into the skin.</li><li>Put the fennel, bay leaves, garlic, cardamom, star anise and half the fennel seeds into a hot roasting tin on the hob with a little oil and heat for about 2 minutes until aromatic. Push to the side of the tray, then add the pork, skin-side down and coo for at least 5 minutes until turning golden brown. Turn the pork over, season the skin again with salt and sprinkle with the remaining fennel seeds. Pour in the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up the bits from the bottom (be careful not to get the skin of the pork wet). Bring to the boil, then pour in enough stock to come to the layer of fat just below the skin and allow to boil again.</li><li>Transfer the tray to the oven and cook for 2.5hrs.</li><li>Transfer the meat to a warm plate and set aside to rest. Meanwhile, spoon off any excess fat in the roasting tin. Heat the tin on the hob, adding the mustard. Mix in with a whisk, then taste and adjust the flavours as necessary. Remove the star anise and cardamom pods and pour the sauce into a jug.</li><li>Serve the rested pork with the sauce and dauphinoise potatoes.</li></ol></article><footer><hr><p class=footer_notes><span id=lang_available></span><br><span class=copyright>©2021 Comp-Soc Edinburgh.
