You want the dough to be fairly thin, around ~2-3mm of thickness.</li><li>Using the rim of a floured drinking glass, cut out circles in the rolled-out dough.</li><li>Picking up one circle at a time, put in the filling — 1-2 teaspoons, depending on your confidence, fold the circle in half and crimp the edges shut.</li><li>Repeat until all the pierogi are prepared. Keep the finished pierogi on a floured baking sheet and covered so they don&rsquo;t dry out.</li></ol><p>To cook the pierogi:</p><ol><li>Working in batches, put the pierogi in boiling water. Reduce to a simmer, and cook for a few minutes; once they start rising to the surface, check for doneness. Remove with a slotted spoon once done.</li></ol><p>To serve:
The cooked pierogi can be eaten or reheated as they are - or you can pan-fry them in a bit of oil and serve them with some caramelized onions, fried bacon bits, and some sour cream.</p><h3>Fillings</h3><h4>Mushroom and sauerkraut</h4><h5>Ingredients</h5><ul><li>200g-400g sauerkraut, to taste</li><li>One bag of dried mushrooms (~20g) or one box of fresh brown mushrooms (~200g)</li><li>(Optional) One bay leaf</li><li>Onions</li></ul><h5>Method</h5><ol><li>Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water for around 30 minutes. Drain most of the soaking liquid, reserving some for adding later. Chop roughly.</li><li>Drain and rinse the sauerkraut, chop roughly.</li><li>Add the sauerkraut and dried mushrooms (and optionally the bay leaf) to a pot. Cook for 30-40 minutes, adding liquid if needed, until the sauerkraut is cooked.</li><li>While the sauerkraut is cooking, fry the onions in a bit of oil, optionally caramelizing. If you are using fresh mushrooms, finely chop them and fry them in the same pot.</li><li>Mix the sauerkraut and the onions together to make the filling. Remember to remove the bay leaf!</li></ol><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=yutotakano/cook-book data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODEzOTAwNjU=" data-category="Recipe Comments" data-category-id=DIC_kwDOFruM8c4B-MRy data-mapping=pathname data-reactions-enabled=1 data-theme=light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article><footer><hr><p class=footer_notes><span id=lang_available></span><br><span class=copyright>©2021 Comp-Soc Edinburgh.
